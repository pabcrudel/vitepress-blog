# VitePress Blog

Static Blog generated using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a `SSG`
framework that combines `Vite` + `Vue.js` + `Markdown`.

Most programming tools that I use on my projects have a website wiki that teach
it's user how to use it. I notice that the style of these wikis was too close. I
look into on the internet and I found `VitePress`. I don't know if all of them
are using it however, I decide to start learning this framework in order to
develop user friendly wikis of my future projects.
